# eCommerce Backend

## Description
This program interacts with a SQL database, allows relationships between tables, and allows someone to track products, their categories, and tags for each product. This allows for easier management of products. I learned how route CRUD functions for adding and deleting products, categories, or tags.

## Installation
This requires installation of Node.js for it to run. Please run 'npm start' to install all required packages. It also requires a .env file to establish the SQL host, its username, and its password.

## Usage
Here is an example of the program running:
